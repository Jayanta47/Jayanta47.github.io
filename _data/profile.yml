  &#x1F44B Hi I'm Jayanta. I'm a learner and aspiring researcher. My interest lies in the fields of <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP), AI Fairness, Trustworthy ML and Efficient ML</b>. My current career goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in my field of interest.
  <br/><br/>
  üíº I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer @ <a href="https://www.iqvia.com/">IQVIA</a>.
  <br/><br/>
  &#x1F4DC I've been the first author of 3 research papers on Bias and Fairness. Our paper titled <b>"An Empirical Study on the Characteristics of Bias upon Context Length Variation for Bangla"</b>
  has been accepted at the findings section of the <b>64th Conference of Computational Linguistics  (ACL'2024)</b>. 
  Other two works of mine are on Emotion and Social Biases in LLM Responses for Bangla Language. Among these, one paper titled <b>"An Empirical Study of Gendered Stereotypes in Emotional Attributes for Bangla in Multilingual Large Language Models"</b> has been <b>accepted in the 5th Workshop on Gender Bias in Natural Language Processing at ACL 2024!</b>
  Please refer to my <a href="https://www.jayanta47.github.io/research/">research</a> section for more details.
  <br/><br/>
  üè´ I am a graduate from the <b>Department of Computer Science and Engineering(CSE)</b> from <b>Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology</b>. It is a top ranked engineering university in Bangladesh and takes pride in creating some of the best engineers of the country.
  <br/><br/>
  &#x1F4DA My undergraduate thesis was on <b>"Detecting Gender Bias in Bangla Language Models"</b> under the supervision of <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty_list/detail/rifat">Dr. Rifat Shahriyar</a>. 
  In this work, we tried to show a detailed analysis of the responses of Bangla Language models in both static and contextual settings for the detection of gender bias. Our nuanced analysis for the context of Bangla 
  gave us an insight about how the models respond owing to the inclusion of explcit or implicit gender.
  <br/><br/>
  &#x1F3C6 In my undergraduate life at buet, I've regularly participated and excelled at multiple competitions including 
  <b>Dhaka AI 2020</b> and <b>HackNSU 2020</b>. I have taken up leadership roles at my departmental occasions especially our department's annual event <b>BUET CSE FEST</b>.
  <br/><br/>
  &#x1F3A1 In my leisure time, I enjoy reading thriller novels, listening to music and watching tv-series and movies.
  <br/><br/>
  üòÉ Fun Fact: My Personality type is <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality"><b>INFP</b></a>. I like to call myself an <b>Empirical Skeptic</b>.
