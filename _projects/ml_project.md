about: >-
    This project was about predicting the possibility of a person having a stroke based on various features. The dataset was taken from Kaggle and was quite imbalanced. Therefore, we did data preprocessing, data sampling, and then trained a feed-forward neural network (FNN) model. We used NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for this project.
