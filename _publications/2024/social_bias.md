  This research project, supervised by Dr. Rifat Shahriyar, focused on examining social biases in large language models (LLMs) for the Bangla language. The study involved investigating two distinct types of social biases in Bangla LLMs. We developed a curated dataset to benchmark bias measurement and implemented two probing techniques for bias detection. This work represents the first comprehensive bias assessment study for Bangla LLMs, with all code and resources made publicly available to support further research in bias detection for Bangla NLP. Please refer to the paper link for more details.
