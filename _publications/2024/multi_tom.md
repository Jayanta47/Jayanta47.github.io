  This research project is to examine the cognitive capabilities of Large Language Models(LLM) in the domain Theory of Mind(ToM) test across languages. The objective of this project is to ascertain the capabilities of LLMs in the setup of multilingual ToM questionnaire. We also want to study if the inclusion of cultural elements specific to languages changes the performance of the LLMs in terms of cognitive abilities. <b>Had the opportunity to supervise two junior students in this project.</b>
