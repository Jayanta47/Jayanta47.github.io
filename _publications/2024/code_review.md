    This is an ongoing project of mine under the supervision of Dr. Anindya Iqbal. Our aim here is to produce more human like reviews and automating review generation procedure through large language models. We are working on the latest RL based preference optimization to finetune SOTA open source LLMs and figure out more suitable evaluation metric to find out human likeliness of code review. The knowledge domains we need in this study are: Code review, LLM inference, LLM finetuning and Objective evaluation.
