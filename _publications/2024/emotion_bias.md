  In this study, we conducted a research that investigated gendered stereotypes in emotional attributes within multilingual large language models (LLMs) for Bangla. The study analyzed historical patterns, revealing how women were often associated with emotions like empathy and guilt, while men were linked to emotions such as anger and authority in Bangla-speaking regions. We evaluated both closed and open-source LLMs to identify gender biases in emotion attribution. The project included qualitative and quantitative analysis of LLM responses to Bangla gender attribution tasks and highlighted the influence of gendered role selection on these outcomes. We also developed and publicly shared datasets and code to support further research in Bangla NLP. Please refer to the paper link for more details.
