 This research project, which formed the basis of my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of Dr. Rifat Shahriar, explored the nuances of gender bias detection in Bangla language models. We constructed a curated dataset for detecting gender bias in both static and contextual setups and compared different bias detection methods specifically tailored to Bangla. The study established benchmark statistics using baseline methods and analyzed bias in various language models supporting Bangla, including BanglaBERT, MuRIL, and XML-RoBERTa. A key focus was understanding how the context length of templates and sentences affects bias detection outcomes. This work serves as a foundational study for bias detection in Bangla language models. Please refer to the paper link for more details.
