abstract: >-
  Pretrained language models inherently exhibit
  various social biases, prompting a crucial examination of their social impact across various
  linguistic contexts due to their widespread usage. Previous studies have provided numerous methods for intrinsic bias measurements,
  predominantly focused on high-resource languages. In this work, we aim to extend these
  investigations to Bangla, a low-resource language. Specifically, in this study, we (1) create
  a dataset for intrinsic gender bias measurement
  in Bangla, (2) discuss necessary adaptations to
  apply existing bias measurement methods for
  Bangla, and (3) examine the impact of context
  length variation on bias measurement, a factor
  that has been overlooked in previous studies.
  Through our experiments, we demonstrate a
  clear dependency of bias metrics on context
  length, highlighting the need for nuanced considerations in Bangla bias analysis. We consider our work as a stepping stone for bias measurement in the Bangla Language.
