abstract: >-
  This research project, conducted between November 2023 and January 2024, focused on improving inference time for protein folding predictions using advanced protein folding models. We utilized reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning of large language models to achieve both low-resource training and targeted performance improvements. The project required expertise in protein sequencing and folding models such as AlphaFold and ESM, as well as skills in designing loss functions. The technical stack included PyTorch, biotite-python, omegaconf, hydra-core, and transformers.
