    This is a research project that I did as a part of my coursework in Machine Learning Sessional course, supervised by Dr. Saifur Rahman. The project's goal was to generate abstractive summaries of Bangla text using a Bangla language generative model. To improve the model's performance and surpass the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in Bangla, we implemented contrastive learning techniques. Our work was guided by concepts from the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16804.pdf">BRIO</a> paper, which served as a key reference throughout the project.
